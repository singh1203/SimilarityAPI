# Similarity API App

This project is a Similarity API application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It's designed as a learning tool to understand TypeScript, Next.js source-based structuring, and React component-based pages and layouts.

## Features

- **Rate Limited API routes**: Protect your API from excessive requests.
- **Protection of sensitive routes**: Secure your application's sensitive information.
- **Google authentication**: Authenticate users via Google.
- **Typescript**: Ensure type safety and improve developer tooling.
- **API key system**: Create and revoke user keys for API access.
- **Radix UI Primitives**: Utilize a low-level UI component library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style your app with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Fonts with next/font**: Optimize web fonts with Next.js.
- **Icons from Lucide**: Enhance your UI with open-source icons.
- **Dark mode with next-themes**: Implement dark mode with ease.
- **Class merging with tailwind-merge**: Combine Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Animation with tailwindcss-animate**: Animate elements with Tailwind CSS.
- **Conditional classes with clsx**: Conditionally apply CSS classes.
- **Variants with class-variance-authority**: Manage variant classes in your application.

## Overview

The application uses a similarity API to compare different inputs and return their similarity score. It's built using the latest version of Next.js (13) and TypeScript for strong typing and enhanced developer experience.

## Project Structure

The project follows a source-based structure, with each page represented by a React component in the `src` directory. The layout of the application is also component-based, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13**: The latest version of the Next.js framework, offering features like server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, used to ensure type safety and improve developer tooling.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create reusable UI components.
